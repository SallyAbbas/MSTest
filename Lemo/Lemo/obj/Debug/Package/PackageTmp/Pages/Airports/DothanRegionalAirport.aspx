Dothan Regional Airport (IATA: DHN, ICAO: KDHN, FAA LID: DHN) is a public use airport in the Dale County portion of Dothan, Alabama, located five nautical miles (9 km) northwest of the central business district of Dothan, a city primarily in Houston County, Alabama, United States.[1] Although it is a commercial use airport, airline service is limited to a single regional carrier. Over 50% of its annual flights are military aviation training operations from nearby Fort Rucker, NAS Whiting Field and NAS Pensacola, while just under 40% are local and itinerant general aviation.

History[edit]

In 1941 the United States Army Air Corps constructed Napier Field, named in honor of Major Edward L. Napier of Union Springs, Alabama. One of the Army's first flight surgeons, he was killed in the crash of a Fokker D.VII, AS-5382,[2] at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, on 15 September 1923. He had been a Medical Corps Officer in World War I and had transferred to the Army Air Corps. He was receiving training as a flight surgeon at the time of his death. The official report states that he was piloting the plane himself and there was a structural failure of a wing.[3]
Napier Field was assiged to the Southeast Training Center of the Army Air Forces Training Command. It was commanded by the 73d Army Air Force Base Unit. In addition to the main facility, the following known sub-bases and auxiliaries were constructed to support the training operations:
Cairns Army Airfield 31°16′33″N 085°42′48″W
Wiksburg Auxiliary Field 31°19′10″N 085°40′25″W (Now: Knox Army Heliport, Fort Rucker)
Dothan Auxiliary Field 31°14′28″N 085°26′36″W
Headland Auxiliary Field 31°21′51″N 086°18′56″W
Goldberg Auxiliary Field (Undetermined location)
Hyman Auxiliary Field 31°18′48″N 085°07′32″W
The 29th Flying Training Wing was activated at Napier on 26 December 42. The 2116th (Pilot School, Advanced, Single-Engine) was main operational group at Napier Field. The group flew mostly AT-6 Texans as well as providing advanced & specialized training in single engine aircraft, including P-40 fighters. The first aircraft began operating on the field on October 1, 1941.
On 20 December 1941, the first group of British cadets arrived for training. The first American cadets graduated on July 3, 1942 (42-F). In late May 1945, officers from the Mexican Army began P-40 training at Napier Field.
The field was deactivated on 31 October 1945, and the airfield and its improvements were subsequently made available to the City of Dothan and Houston County under an Agreement in 1946 which was jointly accepted at that time. The airport lands lay dormant for about 20 years and Houston County later turned its share of Napier Field to the City.
In the early 1960s, a complete overhaul of the facility commenced with the old AAF airfield layout being largely dug up and turned into hardcore for new jet runways, buildings and other facilities built for a civilian airport. Dothan Regional Airport opened to commercial activity on February 15, 1965.[4] [5] [6] [7]
