Built in 1951 as Anchorage International Airport, it was renamed by the Alaska Legislature to honor former long-standing U.S. Senator Ted Stevens. It is Alaska Airlines' third-largest hub, after Seattle and Portland. Anchorage was a common stopover for passengers flying to East Asia from the 1960s to the 1980s because Chinese and Soviet airspace were off-limits and because the first generation of jets and widebody airliners did not have the range to fly nonstop across the Pacific Ocean. On September 1, 1983 one of these flights, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet pilot who had mistaken it for a spy plane, after unintentionally violating Soviet airspace. A few charter passenger aircraft still stop at Anchorage on flights between Asia and the eastern United States. However, cargo carriers - which benefit from more volume and thus shorter route segments - continue to use Anchorage frequently.
The eastern end of the airport's southernmost runway connected to the former Kulis Air National Guard Base, which was located on land leased by the airport.

Passenger traffic[edit]

Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport's passenger traffic has hovered around the five million mark for the last 10 years, apart from in 2002 when the airport suffered a 13% drop in traffic. Fairbanks and Juneau are the next busiest airports though neither managed more than half a million passengers last year. Anchorage traffic peaks in June, July and August when passenger numbers are twice as high as between October and April.[3] Most major U.S. passenger carriers serve ANC, with the majority of passenger flight operations by Alaska Airlines to and from Seattle (an average of 20 flights per day) and Fairbanks (an average of 13 flights per day).
Anchorage is also envisioned as a future connecting point for air traffic to the Russian Far East. During the summer season 2008, there was one weekly flight to Russia by Vladivostok Air. Yakutia Airlines resumed summer seasonal service to Russia in 2012.[4] Many of Alaska's North Slope workers live either in Anchorage or elsewhere in the Lower 48 states and fly through the airport to their jobs in Prudhoe Bay.
International cargo hub[edit]

Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is also a major cargo hub. As of 2010, it ranked as the fifth busiest airport in the world by cargo traffic, after Hong Kong, Memphis, Shanghai, and Seoul.
FedEx Express and UPS Airlines operate major hubs at Anchorage International for cargo heading to and from the Far East.[3] NWA Cargo used to operate a major hub at the airport until December 28, 2009 when it closed all operations for Northwest Cargo at all airports. FedEx Express is the airport's largest cargo facility and can handle as many as 13,400 packages per hour, employing more than 1,200 people and providing a full customs clearance system. United Parcel Service's hub handles about 5,000 parcels per hour. Both companies forecast a large growth in traffic over the next several years as trade with China and other Far East countries increases and plan to expand their Anchorage facilities comparatively. The United States Postal Service also operates a large sectional center facility (SCF) for the 995xx ZIP codes. It processes mail and parcels headed to and from all Alaska cities.
Facilities and aircraft[edit]



Runway layout at ANC
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport covers 4,500 acres (1,821 ha) and has three asphalt paved runways: 7L/25R measuring 10,600 x 150 ft (3,231 x 46 m), 7R/25L at 12,400 x 200 ft (3,780 x 61 m) and 15/33 at 11,584 x 150 ft (3,531 x 46 m).[1]
For 12-month period ending December 14, 2006, the airport had 289,472 aircraft operations, an average of 793 per day: 37% scheduled commercial, 35% general aviation, 27% air taxi and 1% military. There are 169 aircraft based at this airport: 59% multi-engine, 27% helicopters, 11% military and 3% jet aircraft.[1]
The FAA has forecast total operations for the year 2011 to be 261,375. By the year 2030 this number is expected to rise to 334,279 or 918.882 operations per day.[5]
For 12-month period ending December 31, 2009, the airport had a total of 2,102,088 enplaned passengers go through the terminals.[6]
Terminals[edit]

South Terminal (domestic)[edit]
The South Terminal serves Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Condor (Departures), Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Sun Country, United Airlines, US Airways and Virgin America. All regional intrastate carriers also use the South Terminal.
The terminal contains 3 concourses: Concourse A, Concourse B, and Concourse C. Concourse C was completely rebuilt in 2004 while Concourses A and B were built in 1985 and 1969 respectively and renovated in 2009.[7] Architects HNTB and RIM Architects performed the architectural work for these projects.[8]
North Terminal (international)[edit]
The North Terminal serves Condor (Arrivals), Icelandair, Yakutia Airlines, and international seasonal charter flights. In addition to these airlines, a few cargo airlines use the north side of the terminal for parking. This terminal was built in 1982.[7]
Airlines and destinations[edit]

US mainline carriers operate a combination of year-round and seasonal service to the lower 48 states and Hawaii. Foreign carriers operate seasonal flights and seasonal charters to Asia and Europe, sold as bundled services. China Airlines terminated ANC-TPE service, due to availability of longer range aircraft (reducing the need for an incidental stop), compounded by $2.5 million levy by the TSA[9]

Ground transport[edit]

Inter-terminal[edit]
A shuttle bus runs approximately every 15 minutes between the North and South terminals and the employee and long-term parking lots. A land-side inter-terminal walkway was completed in 2009. Air-side connections between the sterile areas of each terminal are not available.
To/from airport[edit]
Route 7A of the Anchorage People Mover bus system serves the airport's North and South terminals once every hour in each direction, connecting it with the downtown Transit Center and the Dimond Center mall.[21][22]
Taxi queues are available in front of each terminal. Courtesy vans and other ground transportation options pick up from designated areas in front of each terminal.[23]
Major national rental car chains are represented in an on-site consolidated rental car facility attached to the South terminal.[24]
There is a rail station for the Alaska Railroad. It is only available during summer season for cruise ship service only.
Renovations[edit]

Renovations began on the A and B concourses in fall 2006. These renovations are designed to bring the older portions into compliance with current seismic, heating, ventilation, electrical and safety codes, and also include new baggage handling systems and renovations to the interior of the concourses.[25] Since the completion of the construction, all domestic flights are operated out of the South Terminal.
Commissioned art pieces[edit]
Euphony, 2004: Glass Artist - Warren Carther
The piece consists of nine towers of glass, collectively adding up to 42 meters (130 ft) of in span and reaching to 8 meters (26 ft) at its highest point. The series of panels are inspired by Alaska's immensely rugged landscape of glaciers and mountains. The ambiguous images embedded within the sculpture address Alaska’s continual balancing of the forces of technology with the vast powers of the natural world.
Programs[edit]

The airport features an innovative customer service program, which partners with most on-site (and some nearby) vendors and concessionaires and aims to promote a positive image of the airport and the State of Alaska in the minds of travelers. This volunteer, self-funded committee mystery shops at partnering companies and provides awards of cash, free covered parking, and donated prizes to winning employees.[26][27][28]
Accidents and incidents[edit]

On March 27, 1964, the airport's control tower, then attached to the main terminal, collapsed during the Good Friday Earthquake. One person was killed.
On October 1, 1970, Douglas R4D-6 N47 of the Federal Aviation Administration crashed shortly after take-off and was destroyed in the subsequent fire. The aircraft was operating a local training flight. Both crew were killed.[29]
On November 27, 1970, Douglas DC-8-63 of Capitol Airlines crashed on take off from Anchorage killing 47 of 229 passengers and crew on board. http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19701127-1
On November 6, 1974, Douglas C-47 N76 of the Federal Aviation Administration along with Lockheed L-188 Electra N7140C and NAMC YS-11A N172RV of Reeve Aleutian Airways were destroyed in a hangar fire.[30][31][32]
On April 20, 1978, Korean Air Lines Flight 902 a Boeing 707 was shot down by the Soviet Air Force while flying from Paris, France to Anchorage, Alaska and continuing to Seoul, South Korea. Two passengers were killed in the Explosive Decompression and the flight was able to land on a frozen lake were the remaining passengers and crew were transported to safety and then flown out of the Soviet Union back to South Korea
On December 4, 1978, a Learjet 25C en route from Juneau crashed upon landing. Onboard were U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, his wife Ann, lobbyist and former Alaska Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development (and future U.S. Ambassador to Brazil) Langhorne A. Motley, prominent Anchorage lawyer Joseph Rudd, and three others. The party were traveling from the second-term inauguration of Alaska governor Jay Hammond to an Anchorage fundraiser organized by Motley. Motley and Ted Stevens were the only survivors.[33]
On 8 June 1983, Reeve Aleutian Airways Flight 8's propeller separated from the Lockheed L-188 Electra and tore a hole in the fuselage over the Pacific Ocean causing an explosive decompression and loss of control. The pilots managed to land the aircraft safely at Anchorage and all 15 passengers and crew survived. Since the propeller fell into the sea the cause of the separation is undetermined.
On October 9, 2002, a Boeing 747-451, Northwest Airlines Flight 85 en route from Detroit to Tokyo, suffered a Lower rudder hardover. While flying over the Bering Sea the aircraft abruptly went into a 35 through 40 degree left bank after the Lower rudder had swung left 17° and hydraulic failure caused it to be stuck in place. Captain Frank Geib and First Officer Mike Fagan were at the controls at the time, having just taken over from Senior Captain John Hanson and First Officer David Smith. Geib declared an emergency and turned the aircraft back towards Anchorage. Hanson had returned to the cockpit and soon took over the controls. He and Fagan then flew the aircraft for over an hour before successfully landing in Anchorage. In order to steer the aircraft they had to use asymmetric engine thrust, or varying input into the engines as they were unable to use the ailerons at the time. No passengers or crew were injured, but the incident resulted in an airworthiness directive to prevent the possibility of a future accident.
