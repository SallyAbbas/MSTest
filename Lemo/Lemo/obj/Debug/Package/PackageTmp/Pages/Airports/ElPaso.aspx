El Paso (/ɛlˈpæsoʊ/; from Spanish, 'the pass') is the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, and lies in far West Texas.
As of the 2010 census, the city's population was 649,121.[3] El Paso is the 19th most populous city in the United States and the sixth most populous city in the state of Texas. Its metropolitan area covers all of El Paso County, whose population in 2010 was 800,647.[3] The El Paso MSA forms part of the larger El Paso – Las Cruces combined statistical area, with a total population of 1,013,356 as of the 2010 Census.
El Paso stands on the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte), across the border from Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. The two cities form a combined international metropolitan area, sometimes called the Paso del Norte or El Paso–Juárez, with Juárez being the significantly larger of the two in population. They have a combined population of 3 million, two-thirds of whom reside in Juárez. In 2010, El Paso was awarded an All-America City Award, the oldest community-recognition program in the United States.
El Paso is home to the University of Texas at El Paso (founded in 1914 as the Texas State School of Mines and Metallurgy, and later, Texas Western College; its current name dates from 1967). El Paso is also home to the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso. Fort Bliss, one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army, lies to the east and northeast of the city, with training areas extending north into New Mexico, up to the White Sands Missile Range and neighboring Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo. El Paso is the first large city in the world to have a spaceport in the vicinity. Spaceport America, which lies 89 miles from El Paso, has seen the completion of several successful manned, suborbital flights. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the western half forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the eastern slopes connect in the central business district at the south end of the mountain range.

History[edit]

Main article: History of El Paso, Texas
The El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks.[5] The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. At the time of the arrival of the Spanish, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area and were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comanchería, and genízaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache roamed the region, as well.
Spanish explorer Don Juan de Oñate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598,[6] celebrating Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (several decades before the Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narváez expedition, Juan Dirac, Francisco Chuvash, Maria Munoz and Terea Franco, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s.[7] El Paso del Norte (the present day Juárez), was founded on the south bank of the Río Bravo del Norte, (Rio Grande) in 1659 by Spanish conquistadors. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico, remaining the largest settlement in New Mexico until its cession to the US in 1848, when Texas took it in 1850.

El Paso remained largely undeveloped during most of the period of Spanish control. Instead, Spanish settlement was centered on El Paso del Norte (the present day Ciudad Juárez). However, the Spanish crown and the local authorities of El Paso del Norte had made several land concessions to bring agricultural production to the northern bank of the river in present-day El Paso City, frequent Indian raids and warfare overwhelmed any attempts. The Apache Wars and subsequent Comanche Wars left northern Mexico, then including present-day New Mexico, Texas, and Coahuila, in a state of perpetual instability. Consequently, present-day Juárez remained the northern-most villa with the Río Bravo del Norte, and Apache attacks dissuading settlement and development north. The water of the river, the sand dunes to the south (médanos), and the fortifications at Paso del Norte and El Real de San Lorenzo provided a natural defense against further raids; however, in some decades, several-thousand-strong Apache armies made raids deep into Mexico, slaughtering the male population and enslaving women and children. As a result, the Rio Grande proved to be a boundary line of actual Hispanic presence.
Nonetheless, in the early years of Spanish power, areas north of the Rio Grande were gradually colonized after several decades of attempts. The Hispanic civilian and military population, and the small community of Spanish friars and their Amerindian wards ranched the area, which was grassland at the time, and developed small-scale but successful agriculture consisting of vineyards and fruits. However, in 1680, after the successful Pueblo Revolt that decimated the Spanish colonies in northern New Mexico, Paso del Norte became the base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico with the present-day El Paso remaining a neutral battleground.
From El Paso, the Spaniards led by Diego de Vargas, grouped to recolonize the Spanish territory centered on Santa Fe, stretching from Socorro to Taos. The Bourbon reforms of the 18th century affected the Paso del Norte, as New Spain's enlightened bureaucrats deemed the region, with a thriving population of over 10,000 by mid-century, capable of self-defense. Viceregal troops garrisoned in the Presidio of Paso del Norte were redeployed elsewhere on New Spain's frontier. New policies of Indian gifting helped to stabilize relations with the Apaches and Comanches, providing a respite to El Paso's agriculturalist population.
With the Mexican Constitution of 1824, part of present-day El Paso became the southernmost locality of the Territorio de Nuevo Mexico (modern New Mexico) and part of the newly established state of Chihuahua. It communicated with Santa Fe and Mexico City by the Royal Road ( el Camino Real de Tierra Adentro).
The Texas Revolution (1836) was not felt in the region, as the area was never considered part of Texas until 1848. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan María Ponce de León, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson began to establish themselves. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San José de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844. Given the reclamations of the Texas Republic that wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river a formal American settlement, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side.[8] The present Texas–New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.

El Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called "The Post opposite El Paso" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1854. Further west, a settlement on Coons' Rancho called Franklin became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas. A year later, pioneer Anson Mills completed his plan of the town, calling it El Paso.[9]
During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.[10]
After the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow. El Paso, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, attracting newcomers ranging from businessmen and priests, to gunfighters and prostitutes. El Paso became a violent and wild boomtown known as the "Six Shooter Capital" because of its lawlessness.[9] Prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Juárez). The city developed into the premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the US Southwest.
The Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees—and capital—to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. The population exceeded 100,000. The Jesuit Order established a network of schools catering to the children of the Mexican community, and the large number of refugee floating population was attended by various philanthropic organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund.[11]

Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The Arizona and Southeastern Railroad was slowly extended toward El Paso (owned by the Phelps Dodge company), to allow the construction of a second copper refinery in El Paso to refine ore produced in Arizona and southwestern New Mexico by Phelps Dodge. In 1901, the Arizona Southeastern Railroad was renamed the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, and the tracks finally reached El Paso in 1902.
The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging,[9] but as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II. Following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.

El Paso is located at 31°47′25″N 106°25′24″W (31.790208, −106.423242).[12] It lies at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the US and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain time. Ciudad Juárez used to be on Central Time,[13] but both cities are now on Mountain time.
The city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).[14]
The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.
The Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Doña Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.
El Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region.
Being in the westernmost tip of Texas, and due to the huge size of the state, El Paso is closer to four other state capitals (US and Mexican) than it is to its own capital of Austin, Texas (the other capitals being Phoenix, Arizona, Santa Fe, New Mexico, neighboring Mexican city Chihuahua (Chihuahua), and Hermosillo (Sonora)).[15][not in citation given][16][dead link]

Climate[edit]


Snow on Franklin Mountains


Rio Grande in El Paso's Upper Valley
El Paso has a hot desert climate (Köppen BWh) with very hot summers, usually with little humidity, and mild, dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.4 in (240 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.
The sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed "The Sun City".[18] Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h)[citation needed] and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h),[citation needed] these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.
El Paso, at 3,800 ft (1,200 m) elevation, is also capable of receiving snow; weather systems have produced over a foot of snow on several occasions. In 1980, three major snowstorms produced over a foot of snow; one in February, another in April and the last one in December, producing a white Christmas for the city.[citation needed] A major snowstorm in December 1987 dumped over two ft (65 cm) of snow.[19]
One example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 °F (−9 °C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 °F (−17 °C), surpassing the 5 °F (−15 °C) set during the cold wave of 1899.[20] Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Electric wires were broken, causing area blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days. When the pipes thawed, water was unsafe to drink due to filtration systems not working, forcing schools to close again.[citation needed]
Monthly means range from 44.8 °F (7.1 °C) in December to 82.8 °F (28.2 °C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon. On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 °F (38 °C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day.[19] The city's record high is 114 °F (46 °C), and its record low is −8 °F (−22 °C); the highest daily minimum was 85 °F (29 °C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.
Flooding[edit]


Rio Grande in west El Paso near New Mexico state line
Although the average annual rainfall is only about 9 in (225 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, over 15 in (380 mm) of rain fell in a week, overflowing all the flood-control reservoirs and causing major flooding city-wide. The city staff has estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) as $77 million.[21] Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.

El Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 296-foot (90 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizonal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters "UTEP" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.

In 2010, many Mexicans fleeing drug violence in Ciudad Juárez settled in El Paso. Benjamin Sáenz, a novelist and a literature professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, said during that year that El Paso was "becoming a lot more Mexican and a lot less Chicano."[33]
The Tigua Indians of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo[edit]


The Ysleta Mission, located in the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo within the municipality of El Paso
Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Nation, with its own governing body, lies between the cities of El Paso and Socorro.[34] It is one of three federally recognized Indian tribes in Texas.[35]
The Tigua Indians have been at their present location since a successful Pueblo Revolt of 1680 that forced the Spaniards and New Spaniards (future Mexicans) to retreat south to present-day Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua and El Paso.[36] The tribe is led by a governor and a tribal council. Elections for tribal governor and tribal council are held annually. Frank Paz, the current governor, is serving his second consecutive term.[37]
Government[edit]

Municipal[edit]
The city government is officially nonpartisan. Mayors and city council members may not serve for more than 10 years in their respective offices.[38]
The city operates under a council-manager form of government, which combines the strong political leadership of elected officials, in the form of eight council members, with the strong managerial experience of an appointed local government manager. All power is concentrated in the elected council, which hires a professionally trained manager to carry out its directives and oversee the delivery of public services.[38] Joyce Wilson was selected by the city council in 2004 as El Paso's first city manager.
The current mayor of El Paso is Oscar Leeser, who was elected mayor in 2013.[39] He succeded John Cook, who served from 2005 to 2013.[40]
The current members of the El Paso City Council, who are elected every four years to staggered terms, are Emma Acosta (District 3; East Central), Lilia Limon (District 7; Mid Valley), Carl Robinson (District 4; Northeast), and Larry Romero (District 2; West Central), whose terms will end in 2017,[41] and Eddie Holguin (District 6; East Valley), Cortney Niland (District 8; Southside), Ann Lilly (District 1; Westside), and Dr. Michiel Noe (District 5; Eastside), whose terms will end in 2015. Mayor Leeser's term will end in 2017.
Lilly and Holguin have been on the council since 2005, Acosta since 2008, Robinson since 2009, Niland and Noe since 2011, and Limon and Romero since 2013. Due to the term limits clause of the city charter, several council members will not be eligible to run again. Holguin and Lilly are not eligible to run for re-election in 2015, and Acosta and Robinson are not eligible to run for re-election in 2017.[42][43]
Municipal elections are currently held in May in odd-numbered years, but a voter-approved charter amendment will change this to November in even-numbered years, beginning in 2018.[44]
Law enforcement is provided by the El Paso Police Department, of which Greg Allen is the current chief.[45]
El Paso County[edit]
The El Paso County judge is Democrat Veronica Escobar, and the county commissioners are Democrats Carlos Leon (Precinct 1), Sergio Lewis (Precinct 2), Vince Perez (Precinct 3), and Republican Dan Haggerty (Precinct 4).[46][47] Haggerty was first elected to his position in 1994, and has been in office since 1995. Escobar and Lewis were first elected to their positions in 2010, and have been in office since 2011. Leon and Perez were first elected to their positions in 2012, and have been in office since 2013.
The El Paso County Sheriff is Richard Wiles, Democrat, since 2009.
State[edit]
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the El Paso I District Parole Office in the city. The El Paso II District Parole Office is in an unincorporated area east of Horizon City.[48]
Texas Legislature[edit]
El Paso City and County vote overwhelmingly Democratic, like most of the Texas–Mexico border area and urban Texas.[49] The El Paso metropolitan area is represented in the Texas State House by Democrats Marisa Marquez, Naomi Gonzalez, Joe Pickett, Mary Gonzalez, and Joe Moody, and in the State Senate by José R. Rodríguez (D-El Paso).[43]

Economy[edit]

More than 70 Fortune 500 companies have offices in El Paso, including Hoover, Eureka, Boeing, and Delphi.
El Paso is an important entry point to the US from Mexico. Once a major copper-refining area, chief manufacturing industries in El Paso now include food production, clothing, construction materials, electronic and medical equipment, and plastics. Cotton, fruit, vegetables, livestock, and pecans are produced in the area. With El Paso's climate and natural beauty, tourism has become a booming industry, as well as trade with neighboring Ciudad Juárez.


Helen of Troy corporate office
El Paso is the operational headquarters of Helen of Troy Limited, a NASDAQ-listed company that manufactures personal health care products under many labels, such as OXO, Dr. Scholl's, Vidal Sassoon, and Sunbeam, among others. Also headquartered in El Paso is Western Refining, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Until 1996, El Paso was home to El Paso Natural Gas Company. It is now in Houston, Texas under the name El Paso Corporation. Farah Clothing Company was also headquartered in El Paso until 1998, when Farah, along with other clothing manufacturing companies such as Levi's, moved their plants in search of cheaper labor. In the 1980s, El Paso was known as the blue jeans capital of the world because it produced over 2 million pair of jeans every week from different jean companies. As of 2006, the only remaining companies in the clothing industry are Wrangler and the smaller company Border Apparel.[citation needed]
Fort Bliss is a major contributor to El Paso's economy. The fort began as a cavalry post in 1848. Today, Fort Bliss is the site of the United States Army's Air Defense Artillery Center, and produces about $80 million in products and services annually, with about $60 million of those products and services purchased locally. Fort Bliss' total economic impact on the area has been estimated at more than $1 billion, with 12,000 soldiers currently stationed there. During the 2005 round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), Fort Bliss came out an enormous winner. By 2013, BRAC growth is expected to add almost 28,000 new troops, 16,000 new spouses, and 21,000 new children to the El Paso community. The growth is expected to create a strong economic ripple throughout the El Paso area. With the growth in Fort Bliss, the economy is expected to profit by $5 billion each year after 2012.
In addition to the military, the federal government has a strong presence in El Paso to manage its status and unique issues as a border region. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation all have agency operations in El Paso to regulate traffic and goods through ports of entry from Mexico.
Many small businesses have arisen to meet the needs of the growth of Fort Bliss, including automotive, food, and retail clothing companies. More specialized companies have emerged which are related directly to the military itself, including (but not limited to) flag and guidon manufacturers and tailoring and uniform companies
Education is also a driving force in El Paso's economy. El Paso's three large school districts are among the largest employers in the area, employing more than 19,000 people among them. The UTEP has an annual budget of nearly $250 million and employs nearly 3,600 people. A 2002 study by the university's Institute for Policy and Economic Development stated the University's impact on local businesses is $349 million annually.


ADP business solutions center
Call center operations make up seven of the top 10 business employers in El Paso. With no signs of growth slowing in this industry, in 2005, the 14 largest call centers in El Paso employed more than 10,000 people. The largest of these in terms of employees are EchoStar, MCI/GC Services, and West Telemarketing. More recently, Automatic Data Processing has opened a business solutions center in West El Paso, employing over 1000 people.
Items and goods produced include petroleum, metals, medical devices, plastics, machinery, automotive parts, food, defense-related goods, tourism, and boots.

Mass transit[edit]
The Sun Metro Mass Transit System operates a system of medium- to large-capacity natural gas-powered buses all around the city of El Paso.[60]

On September 1, 2009, NMDOT Park and Ride began operating commuter bus service to and from Las Cruces, New Mexico.[61]
Historically, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez had a shared streetcar system with a peak electrified route mileage of 64 miles (103 km) in 1920. The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947.[62] The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.[63]


Walk and Bike trail by the Rio Grande
In 2011, Sun Metro was named the most outstanding public transit system of the year in all of North America for a mid-size transit system by the American Public Transportation Association.
Walkability[edit]
A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked El Paso as the 44th most walkable of 50 largest US cities.[64]
International border crossings[edit]
The first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva España, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe.[65] Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.
Several bridges serve the El Paso-Ciudad Juárez area in addition to the Santa Fe Street Bridge, including the Bridge of the Americas, Stanton Street Bridge, and the Zaragoza Bridge.
There is also a land crossing at nearby Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and the Fabens-Caseta International Bridge in nearby Fabens, Texas.
Sports[edit]

Major league teams[edit]
El Paso does not have any major league sports teams at present. El Paso is the third most populated city without a major sports team (NBA basketball, MLB baseball, NFL football, NHL hockey, MLS soccer) in the United States.
El Paso hosts the annual NCAA Hyundai Sun Bowl.
Minor league teams[edit]
On September 18, 2012, the City Council voted to approve the demolition of the current city hall to make way for a new Triple-A baseball stadium, to be the new home of the Tucson Padres (San Diego Padres affiliate) beginning the 2014 season. The team was recently purchased by Mountainstar Sports Group of El Paso.[66]

Radio stations in the El Paso, Texas market
Radio stations from Las Cruces, New Mexico, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, can also be heard within the El Paso market.
Television[edit]
El Paso was the largest city in the United States without a PBS television station within the city limits until 1978. El Paso viewers had to watch channel 22, KRWG, from Las Cruces until 1978. In fact, the city had only three English-speaking channels and two Spanish-language channels (channel 2 and channel 5) from Juarez, and cable TV subscribers in the 1970s and 1980s could receive four Los Angeles independent channels: KTLA, KHJ, KTTV and KCOP. Over time, as more television stations signed on and more cable channels were added (and the internet expanded), the L.A. stations would disappear from the lineup. The last to be removed was KTLA in the fall of 2006, when KVIA-TV opened its own CW station.
El Paso's current television stations are as shown in the table below:
