Fort Wayne is a city in the U.S. state of Indiana and the county seat of Allen County.[5] The population was 255,824 as of the July 1, 2011 Census estimate making it the 74th largest city in the United States and the second largest in Indiana after Indianapolis. The municipality is located in northeastern Indiana, approximately 18 miles (29 km) west of the Ohio border[6] and 50 miles (80 km) south of the Michigan border.[7] Fort Wayne is the principal city of the Fort Wayne metropolitan area, consisting of Allen, Wells, and Whitley counties, for an estimated population of 419,453.[8] In addition to those three core counties, the combined statistical area includes Adams, DeKalb, Huntington, Noble, and Steuben counties, for a population of about 615,077.[8]
Under the direction of American Revolutionary War statesman General "Mad" Anthony Wayne, the United States Army built Fort Wayne last in a series of forts near the Miami Indian village of Kekionga in 1794.[9] Named in Wayne's honor, Fort Wayne established itself at the confluence of the St. Joseph River, St. Marys River, and Maumee River as a trading post for European settlers.[10] The village was platted in 1823 and experienced tremendous growth after completion of the Wabash and Erie Canal and advent of the railroad.[10] Once a booming industrial town located in the Rust Belt, Fort Wayne's economy has diversified in recent times, now relying on distribution, transportation, and logistics, health care, manufacturing, professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and financial services.[11] The city is also a center for the defense contractor industry which employs thousands in the city.[12]
As Northeast Indiana's cultural hub, Fort Wayne is home to 15 museums and art galleries,[13] two daily newspapers,[13] philharmonic orchestra, zoo, three minor league sports franchises and an NCAA Division I team, and 86 parks and playgrounds.[13] The city is home to the fifth largest public university in Indiana,[14] Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne, and the private universities of Concordia Theological Seminary, Indiana Institute of Technology, and University of Saint Francis. The city is also widely recognized as the final resting place of American folklore legend Johnny Appleseed.[15][16]
The city has been an All-America City Award recipient in 1982, 1998, and 2009.[17]

History[edit]

See also: Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana
The Miami nation first established a settlement at the Maumee, St. Joseph, and St. Marys Rivers in the mid-17th century called Kekionga. The village was the traditional capital of the Miami nation and related Algonquian tribes. Historians believe that around 1676, French priests and missionaries visited the Miami on their way back from a mission at Lake Michigan. In 1680, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, sent a letter to the Governor of New France, Louis de Buade de Frontenac stating he had also stopped there. In the 1680s, French traders established a post at the location because it was the crucial portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. The Maumee River is approximately ten miles (16 kilometers) away from the Little River branch of the Wabash River, which flows, in turn, into the Ohio River.[18]


General "Mad" Anthony Wayne
In 1696, Comte de Frontenac appointed Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, as commander of the French outpost in Miami country.[19] The French built the first fort on the site, Fort Miamis, in 1697 as part of a group of forts built between Quebec, Canada, and St. Louis. In 1721, a few years after Bissot's death, Fort Miamis was replaced by Fort St. Philippe des Miamis.[20] The first census, performed in 1744 on the order by the governor of Louisiana, revealed a population of approximately forty Frenchmen and one thousand Miami.[20] Increasing tension between France and the United Kingdom developed over the territory. In 1760, after defeat by British forces in the French and Indian War, the area was ceded to the British Empire. The fort was again renamed, this time to Fort Miami. In 1763, various Native American nations rebelled against British rule and retook the fort as part of Pontiac's Rebellion. The Miami regained control of Kekionga, a rule that lasted for more than 30 years.[20]
In 1790, President George Washington ordered the United States Army to secure Indiana. Three battles were fought in Kekionga against Little Turtle and the Miami Confederacy. Miami warriors annihilated the United States Army in the first two battles. Anthony Wayne led a third expedition, destroying the village while its warriors were away. When the tribe returned to their destroyed village, Little Turtle decided to negotiate peace. After General Wayne refused it, the tribe was advanced to Fallen Timbers where they were defeated on August 20, 1794. On October 22, 1794, the United States army captured the Wabash–Erie portage from the Miami Confederacy and built a new fort at the three rivers, Fort Wayne, in honor of General Wayne.[21]

In 1819, three years after Indiana's statehood, the military garrison was discontinued and a federal land office opened to sell land ceded by local Native Americans by the Treaty of St. Mary's.[22] Platted in 1823, the village quickly became a frontier outpost, and was incorporated as the Town of Fort Wayne in 1829 with a population of 300.[23] The arrival of the Wabash and Erie Canal eased passages to the Great Lakes and Mississippi River, opening Fort Wayne to unprecedented economic opportunities. The population topped 2,000 when the town was incorporated as the City of Fort Wayne on February 22, 1840.[24] Fort Wayne's nickname, The Summit City, came from its position at the highest point along the canal's route.[10] As influential as the Wabash and Erie Canal was to the city's earliest development, it quickly became obsolete after briefly competing with the city's first railroad, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, completed in 1854.[25]
At the turn of the 20th century, the city's population had reached nearly 50,000, attributed mostly to the massive influx of German and Irish immigrants. Fort Wayne's "urban working class" thrived in industrial and railroad-related jobs.[26] Fort Wayne's economy was based substantially on manufacturing which ushered in an era of innovation with several notable inventions coming out of the city over the years. Baking powder, gasoline pumps, the country's first municipal lighting system, first high fidelity phonograph, breathalyzer,[27] refrigerator, garbage disposal, transistor radio, jukebox, calculator, and in 1972, the first home video game console, were developed in Fort Wayne.[28]
With the growing prevalence of the automobile, Fort Wayne became a fixture on the Lincoln Highway, the country's first coast-to-coast highway.[29] Aviation arrived in 1919 with the opening of the city's first airport, Smith Field. The airport served as Fort Wayne's primary commercial airfield until Fort Wayne International Airport was handed over to the city in 1947 after use as a military base during World War II.[30] Fort Wayne was hit by the Great Depression beginning in 1929, with most factories cutting their workforce.[31] The stock market crash however did not discourage plans to build the city's first skyscraper and Indiana's tallest building at the time, the Art Deco Lincoln Bank Tower.[32] By 1935, the New Deal's WPA put over 7,000 residents back to work through various local infrastructure improvements, including the construction of new parks, bridges, viaducts, and a $5.2 million sewage treatment facility. In 1940, the city provided 25 parks totaling 865 acres (350 ha).[33]
The post-World War II economic boom helped the city prosper once again, but began a slow trend shifting business from downtown to the suburbs. Between 1950 and 1955, more than 5,000 homes were built, many in large subdivisions in rural Allen County.[34] Suburban strip malls followed, with the city's first, Anthony Wayne Village, opening in 1947.[34] In 1950, Fort Wayne's first bypass, Coliseum Boulevard, opened on the north side of the city, bringing new opportunities for suburban expansion.[35] The city's first arena, War Memorial Coliseum, further lured business from downtown when it opened September 28, 1952 on the bypass, becoming home to the NBA's Fort Wayne Pistons. Fort Wayne's first enclosed shopping malls, Glenbrook Square (1965) and Southtown Mall (1969), along with the completion of I-69 in rural areas north and west of the city proper, further drove the exodus of retail from downtown through the 1960s.[36] According to 1970s Fort Wayne Home Builders Association estimates, more than 80 percent of new home construction occurred outside the city proper.[37]


Superior Street during the disastrous floods Fort Wayne suffered in 1982.
Like many cities in the Rust Belt, the 1980s brought urban blight, increased crime, notably drug and gang-related violence, and a decrease in blue-collar manufacturing jobs that had helped the city flourish for over a century.[38] Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods continued to decline as more residents and businesses moved further out into rural Allen County.[39] The city endured further battering as a flood inundated Fort Wayne in March 1982. Devastation was widespread, with over 2,000 buildings damaged, costing $56.1 million, and prompting a visit from President Ronald Reagan.[40] However, a herculean civilian effort was launched to beat rising waters; as clay dikes along the Maumee River began to fail, residents worked around the clock to reinforce the dike with sandbags. In the end, 1,860 homes in the Northside neighborhood were spared from damage.[41] The efforts by thousands of volunteers earned Fort Wayne the distinction of The City That Saved Itself.[42]
The 1990s marked a turnaround for the area, as officials focused on crime reduction, economic diversification, and downtown redevelopment efforts. The addition of 30 police officers, an anti-gang unit, expanded take-home police car program, and neighborhood watch program combated Fort Wayne's crime rate; by 1999, the city's crime rate decreased to levels not seen since 1974.[43] Fort Wayne's economy recovered, with the unemployment rate hovering at 2.4 percent in 1998.[43] Clearing blighted buildings while greening downtown became a priority, with the opening of One Summit Square (1991), the Courthouse Green (1999), and Headwaters Park, built at a cost of $16.9 million between 1995 and 1999. Headwaters has since become the premier community gathering space and centerpiece in the city's $50 million flood control project.[43][44] Fort Wayne celebrated its bicentennial in 1994.[43]
Fort Wayne continued focusing on downtown redevelopment and investment in the 2000s.[45] The decade saw the beginnings of a transformation, with the renovations and expansions of the Main Library Branch, Grand Wayne Convention Center, and Fort Wayne Museum of Art. In 2006, the $130 million Harrison Square development was announced, containing a new baseball stadium, parking garage, apartments, retail, and hotel.[46] Parkview Field opened in April 2009 and Courtyard by Marriott in September 2010.[47] In 2011, the underused Anthony Wayne Building began its conversion into 50 condominiums and retail space, costing $15 million.[48] Suburban growth continued, with the opening of Fort Wayne's first lifestyle center, Jefferson Pointe, in 2001 and the $536 million Parkview Regional Medical Center in 2012.[49]
Geography[edit]



A flood wall lining the St. Joseph River in northern Fort Wayne.
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of 110.83 square miles (287.0 km2), of which 110.62 square miles (286.5 km2) (or 99.81%) is land and 0.21 square miles (0.54 km2) (or 0.19%) is water.[50]
Fort Wayne is located at 41°04′50″N 85°08′21″W (41.07253, −85.13937).[51] For a regional summit, Fort Wayne lies on fairly flat land, with the exception of few hills and depressions throughout the region. Marshes and wetlands are prevalent in portions of southwest Fort Wayne and Allen County, as well as some quarries. West of the city lies the Tipton Till Plain while land east of the plain is the former Black Swamp.
The St. Marys River cuts through the southeast section of Allen County, flowing northward, while the St. Joseph River cuts through the northeast section of the county, flowing southward. Both rivers converge roughly in the center of the county to form the Maumee River, which flows northeastward, eventually emptying into Lake Erie. The city lies along the St. Lawrence Continental Divide which separates the Great Lakes Basin from the rest of the Atlantic Ocean watershed.
Fort Wayne's urban tree canopy is 29 percent, double the state average of 14.5 percent[52] and above the national average of 27.1 percent.[53] The canopy is decreasing, notably from development and the emerald ash borer infestation.[52] Fort Wayne has been designated a Tree City USA since 1990.[54]
Climate[edit]
Fort Wayne lies in the humid continental climate zone (Dfa), experiencing four distinct seasons. Typically, summers are hot and humid and winters are generally cold with moderate snowfall. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year.
The National Weather Service reports the highest recorded temperature in the city at 106 °F (41 °C), most recently on June 28, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature at −24 °F (−31 °C) on January 12, 1918.[55] The wettest month on record was July 1986, with 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation recorded. The greatest 24-hour rainfall was 4.93 in (125 mm) on August 1, 1926. The average annual precipitation is 37.9 in (960 mm), recorded at Fort Wayne International. During the winter season, snowfall accumulation averages 32.9 in (84 cm) per year. The snowiest month on record was 29.5 in (75 cm) in January 1982. The greatest 24-hour snowfall was 13.6 in (35 cm) on March 10, 1964.[56] Lake effect snow is not uncommon to the region, but usually appears in the form of light snow flurries.
Severe weather is common, particularly in the spring and summer months.[57] Fort Wayne is especially vulnerable to flooding due to its relatively flat topography, heavy clay soils, and the convergence of three rivers and dozens of other streams.[58]
The most devastating natural disaster to hit the city was the Flood of 1913. Deluged by several days of heavy spring rainstorms, the three rivers spilled over their banks, causing seven deaths, leaving 15,000 homeless, and damaging over 5,500 buildings.[59] The disaster marked a turning point in the city's approach to flood control.[60] The costliest natural disaster, the Flood of 1982, exceeded $56 million in damages to over 2,000 buildings, and forced the evacuation of 9,000.[40] The most severe tornado, an EF2, struck northern Fort Wayne on May 26, 2001, injuring three and causing extensive damage along the Coliseum Boulevard corridor and a subdivision.[61] The city was hit by the Great Blizzard of 1978, with snow drifts up to 20 feet (6.1 m) driven by 55 mph wind gusts.[62] Fort Wayne experienced 91 mph wind gusts in the June 2012 North American derecho, knocking out power to 78,000 and costing $2.5 million.[63]

Fort Wayne has a mayor-council government.[66] Common Council has nine elected members, one representative from each of the city's six council districts and three at-large members, serving four-year terms. The district members represent the constituents living within the boundaries of their jurisdiction, while the at-large members represent the citizens as a whole.[66]
Democrat Tom Henry has been Fort Wayne's mayor since 2008.[67] Mark Becker was appointed to the position of Deputy Mayor in 2012. Becker previously held the position from 2005–2008.[68] Sandra Kennedy has held the city clerk position since 1983.[69]
Under the Unigov provision of Indiana Law, City-County consolidation would have been automatic when Fort Wayne's population exceeded 250,000 and became a first class city in Indiana.[70] Fort Wayne nearly met the state requirements for first class city designation on January 1, 2006 when 12.8 square miles (33 km2) of neighboring Aboite Township (and a small section of Wayne Township) including 25,094 people were annexed.[71] However, a 2004 legislative change raised the population requirements from 250,000 to 600,000, which ensured Indianapolis' status as the only first class city in Indiana.[72]
Public safety[edit]
Municipal and State laws are enforced by the Fort Wayne Police Department, an organization of 460 officers.[73] In 2006, Fort Wayne's crime rate was 5104.1 per 100,000 people, slightly above the national average of 4479.3.[74] There were 18 murders, 404 robberies, and 2,128 burglaries in 2006.[74] Rusty York has served as Police Chief since 2000.[75]
As of 2010, the Fort Wayne Fire Department includes 375 uniformed firefighters and 18 fire stations.[76] Amy Biggs has served as Fire Chief since 2012.[77]

The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.
Religion[edit]
Fort Wayne is sometimes informally called the City of Churches, an unofficial moniker stretching back to the late-19th century when the city was the hub of regional Catholic, Lutheran, and Episcopal faiths.[84] Today, there are approximately 360 churches in the city.[13] As of December 2012, four national Christian denominations were headquartered in Fort Wayne: the American Association of Lutheran Churches, Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association, Missionary Church, Inc., and Fellowship of Evangelical Churches.
Saint Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church was founded in 1837 as Fort Wayne's first Lutheran church and second Lutheran congregation in Indiana.[85] The first Episcopal congregation was established in 1839, attracting New Englanders along with English, Irish, and Canadian immigrants to the city. Trinity Episcopal Church opened in 1850 as the first permanent Episcopal church in Fort Wayne. On the site of today's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, St. Mary's opened as the city's first Catholic parish between 1834 and 1835. Today, Fort Wayne is the principal city of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, covering 14 counties in northeastern and north central Indiana.
Fort Wayne's Reform Judaism population is served by Congregation Achduth Vesholom, the oldest Jewish congregation in Indiana, founded in 1848.[86] In addition, Congregation B'nai Jacob serves the area's Conservative Jewish population. Both congregations participate in the Fort Wayne Jewish Federation. There is an increasing religious minority found among Fort Wayne's immigrant communities, which include Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism.[87]
Economy[edit]

Manufacturing is deeply rooted in Fort Wayne's economic history, dating to the earliest days of the city's growth as an important trade stop along the Wabash and Erie Canal. Railroads, introduced shortly after the canal's arrival, strengthened and eased travel from Fort Wayne to other booming industrial centers along the Great Lakes, such as Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, and Cleveland. Throughout the early and mid-20th century, manufacturing dominated the city's economic landscape. From 1900 to 1930, Fort Wayne's industrial output had expanded by 747 percent, with total production valued at $95 million in 1929, up from $11 million in 1899.[88] The total workforce also increased dramatically, from 18,000 in 1900 to nearly 50,000 in 1930.[88]
Firms with locations in the city included Dana Corporation, Fruehauf Corporation, General Electric, International Harvester, Magnavox, Old Crown Brewing Corporation, and Tokheim, among several others, producing such items as refrigerators, washing machines, automatic phonographs, meat-packing products, televisions, garbage disposals, automotive parts and motors, trailers, gasoline pumps, trucks, beer, tents and awnings.[89] Magnet wire production became an especially vital component to the city's economy. In 1960, Fort Wayne was at the center of the United States magnet wire industry, home to New Haven Wire and Cable Company, Phelps Dodge, Rea Magnet Wire, Superior Essex, and a wire operation at Fort Wayne's General Electric plant, producing nearly 90 percent of North America's magnet wire.[90]
The 1970s and 1980s were times of economic depression in Fort Wayne. As much of the city's manufacturing foundation eroded and the blue-collar workforce shrank, Fort Wayne joined several other cities reeling economically within the Rust Belt.[91] The biggest blow to the city's economy came September 27, 1982 when International Harvester announced it would close its Fort Wayne assembly plant, which had employed 10,600 at its peak. Amid other area plant closures, coupled with the early 1980s recession, the city lost 30,000 jobs and had reached a 12.1 percent unemployment rate.[92] General Motors' arrival to Allen County in 1987 helped fill the void left by International Harvester and aided in the area's recovery, employing 3,000.[93]
Through the 1990s and into the 2000s, the city continued to diversify its economy; manufacturing now employs 16.9 percent of Allen County's workforce.[11] Other important sectors include distribution, transportation, and logistics (23.1 percent), health care (17.9 percent), professional and business services (12.1 percent), leisure and hospitality (11.1 percent), and financial services (6.3 percent).[11] The leisure and hospitality sector has especially grown, with 5.7 million visitors spending more than $466 million in Fort Wayne in 2009.[94] The city has become a center for the defense contracting industry, employing thousands in the city at such companies as BAE Systems (1,015), ITT Exelis (1,203), and Raytheon Systems (950).[12] In 2012, the county's workforce was 174,207 with an unemployment rate of 8.3 percent.[11]
Fort Wayne serves as headquarters for such companies as Do It Best, Franklin Electric, Genteq, Indiana Michigan Power, K&K Insurance, Medical Protective, North American Van Lines, Rea Magnet Wire, Steel Dynamics, Sweetwater Sound, and Vera Bradley. Steel Dynamics is the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in the city, ranking 318th.[95]
According to the Fort Wayne–Allen County Economic Development Alliance, as of February 2013, the ten largest employers in the county were:[96]


Founded in 1905 in the city, Lincoln National Corp. employs nearly 2,000 at the former corporate headquarters downtown.

Trails[edit]


The Ron Venderly Family Bridge crosses the St. Joseph River connecting IPFW with the Rivergreenway.
Since the 1970s, Fort Wayne developed a 24 miles (39 km) system of walking and biking trails along the riverbanks, known as the Rivergreenway, beautifying the riverfronts and promoting healthier living habits for residents.[133] As of 2013, the Rivergreenway had expanded with additional trails to encompass 70 miles (110 km) throughout the city and county.[134] The Rivergreenway was designated a National Recreation Trail in 2009.[135]
In 2007, INDOT awarded the city nearly $1 million to aid in construction of an extension of the Fort Wayne Trail Network, called the Pufferbelly Trail, that would link the Fort Wayne Children's Zoo and northern suburbs of Fort Wayne with the rest of the trail system. The project is a rails to trails initiative, following the abandoned Penn Central right-of-way.[136] The final plan includes joining Pokagon State Park near Angola, Indiana in the north, and Ouabache State Park in the south near Bluffton, Indiana.[137]
With the expansion of trails in recent years, cycling has become important to residents. In 2009, officials announced plans for bicycle lane placement on streets throughout the city[138] and installed more than 250 bike parking places, in accordance with the city's newly adopted comprehensive plan, Bike Fort Wayne.[139] In 2012, the League of American Bicyclists rated the city as Bronze Level for "providing safe accommodation and facilities for bicyclists and encouraging residents to bike for transportation and recreation."[140]

Fort Wayne International Airport is Indiana's third-busiest airport, serving almost 650,000 passengers in 2010.[149] The airport is also home to the 122d Fighter Wing's Fort Wayne Air National Guard Station.[150] Smith Field, in northern Fort Wayne, is used primarily for general aviation.[151]
Fort Wayne is served by a single interstate (Interstate 69) along with an auxiliary beltway (Interstate 469). I-69 runs south, terminating at Interstate 465 in Indianapolis and north, terminating at the Canadian border at Port Huron, Michigan. Unlike most cities comparable to its size, Fort Wayne does not have an urban freeway system. In 1946, planners proposed the construction of a $27 million federally-funded freeway, crossing east-west and north-south through downtown.[152] Opponents successfully campaigned against the proposal, objecting to the demolition of nearly 1,500 homes at the time of the post-World War II housing shortage, while playing on fears that the project would force displaced minorities into white neighborhoods.[153][154] In 1947, Fort Wayne residents voted down the referendum that would have allowed for the construction of the freeway, dubbed the Anthony Wayne Parkway.[155]
I-69 was constructed around the western and northern suburban areas of the city from 1962 to 1971.[156] The I-469 beltway around the southern and eastern fringes of Fort Wayne and New Haven was constructed between 1988 and 1995 as the largest public works project in Allen County history, at $207 million.[155] Completion of I-469 rerouted most federal and state highways around the city instead of through. Four U.S. Routes intersect the city, including US 24, US 27, US 30, and US 33. Five Indiana State Roads also intersect the city, including State Road 1, State Road 3, State Road 14, State Road 37, State Road 930. An extension of Airport Expressway was opened in 2001 linking Fort Wayne International Airport directly to I-69 at a cost of $9.8 million.[157]


Pennsylvania Railroad Station has stood as a landmark to the city's railroad history since opening March 23, 1914.
Amtrak's Broadway Limited (Chicago—Pittsburgh—New York) served the city until 1990 when the line was rerouted north.[158] Amtrak's Capitol Limited is the closest passenger rail service, located some 25 miles (40 km) to the north of Fort Wayne in Waterloo. There has been a movement to bring passenger rail service back to the city in the form of Amtrak or high-speed rail service.[159] Freight service is provided by a class I railroad (Norfolk Southern) and two class III railroads (CSX Transportation).[160] Fort Wayne is also the headquarters and main operations hub of Norfolk Southern's Triple Crown Services subsidiary, the nation's largest truckload shipper.[160]
Fort Wayne's mass transit system is managed by the Fort Wayne Public Transportation Corporation. Citilink provides 12 bus routes through the cities of Fort Wayne and New Haven via downtown's Central Station.[161] CampusLink, which debuted in 2009, is a free shuttle service for students, faculty, and general public traveling between Ivy Tech's Coliseum and North campuses, IPFW and its student housing on the Waterfield Campus, and shopping and residential areas.[162] The system's annual ridership is 2.2 million.[162] Fort Wayne is served by two intercity bus providers: Greyhound Lines (Indianapolis—Toledo—Detroit) and Lakefront Lines (Chicago—Columbus—Akron).[163]
