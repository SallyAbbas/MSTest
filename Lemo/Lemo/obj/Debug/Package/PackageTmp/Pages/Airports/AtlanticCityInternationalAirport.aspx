Atlantic City International Airport (IATA: ACY, ICAO: KACY, FAA LID: ACY) is a joint civil-military public airport located nine nautical miles (17 km) northwest of the central business district of Atlantic City, in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States.[1] Located in the Pomona section of Galloway Township, it is the major component of a national aviation area that lies on portions of three municipalities: Egg Harbor Township, Galloway Township, and Hamilton Township. The airport is accessible via Exit 9 on the Atlantic City Expressway. The facility is operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which also owns the terminal building. Most of the land area is owned by the Federal Aviation Administration.[2]
The facility also serves as a base for the New Jersey Air National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing operating the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon, and the United States Coast Guard's Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City operating the HH-65 Dolphin. The airport is adjacent to the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center, a major research and testing hub for the Federal Aviation Administration, and a training center for the Federal Air Marshal Service. It has also been a past designated alternative landing site for the Space Shuttle.
The airport is served by Spirit Airlines. Additionally, Harrah's Entertainment is offering service to select destinations east of the Mississippi River via its Total Rewards Air. This service is being offered as a scheduled charter and only during the summer months. Flights are offered through Gold Transportation on a Sky King or Pace Airlines 737, or similar aircraft.[3]
The South Jersey Transportation Authority has outlined plans for massive terminal expansions (on top of current initiatives) which might be necessary if more air carriers wish to serve the airport. Total passenger traffic at the airport in 2011 was 1,404,119, making it the 102nd busiest airport in the country. The SJTA owns a small area around the terminal and leases runways and other land from the FAA.[4] New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in March 2013 ordered a takeover of the airport's operations by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[5]

History[edit]



An early photo of the Atlantic City Airport Terminal
In 1942, Naval Air Station Atlantic City was constructed on 2,444 acres (9.89 km2) of leased private land in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. The mission of NAS Atlantic City was to train various carrier air groups consisting of fighter, bomber and torpedo squadrons and their crews for combat.[6]
In November 1958, the then-Federal Aviation Agency, now Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), took over operations of the AMB. The lease transferred to the FAA and was sold for $55,000. Atlantic City decided to retain 84 of the 4,312 acres. The FAA expanded the former U.S. Navy land parcel to approximately 5,000 acres (20 km2) and established the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center research facility that eventually became the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) initially leased portions of the airport from the FAA and now serves as the airport owner and operator of the facility.[6]
In the past, ACY has been served by US Airways with jet service to Pittsburgh and turboprops to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, as well as Continental Express on turboprops and regional jets to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport by Continental Express carrier ExpressJet Airlines on Embraer ERJ series regional jets. Delta Air Lines also offered service to Boston on Delta Connection regional jets operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines until a few years ago. Delta Connection with its partner Comair, also operated flights to Cincinnati and Orlando, which was terminated on May 1, 2007. WestJet served ACY with service to Toronto, but ended service on May 9, 2010, leaving the airport without any international service.
Atlantic City Air National Guard Base[edit]

Since 1958, ACY has also been home to Atlantic City ANGB and the 177th Fighter Wing (177 FW), an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit of the New Jersey Air National Guard operating the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon.[7] Since October 1998, the wing has had an active involvement in Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.[8] As an Air National Guard unit, the 177 FW has dual Federal and State missions. Its Federal mission is "To Provide Combat Ready Citizen-Airmen, Aircraft and Equipment for Worldwide Deployment in Support of USAF Objectives." Its State of New Jersey mission is to "Support the citizens of New Jersey by protecting life and property, preserving the peace, order, and public safety when called upon by the Governor."[8]
Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City[edit]
Main article: Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City
ACY is also home to Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City. CGAS Atlantic City was opened on May 18, 1998 and is the newest and largest single airframe unit and facility of the Coast Guard's Air Stations. It is a product of the merging of the former CGAS Brooklyn/Floyd Bennett Field, NY and Group Air Station Cape May, NJ into one unit. CGAS Atlantic City consists of 10 HH-65C Dolphin helicopters and it maintains two Dolphin helicopters in 30-minute response status. Approximately, 250 aviation personnel comprise the facility's full-time staff, augmented by additional part-time Coast Guard Reserve and Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel. CGAS Atlantic City also provides aircrews and aircraft to the Washington, D.C. area as part of Operation Noble Eagle, the Department of Defense USNORTHCOM / NORAD mission to protect the airspace around the nation's capital.
Facilities[edit]

Atlantic City International Airport covers an area of 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) at an elevation of 75 feet (23 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 4/22 is 6,144 by 150 feet (1,873 x 46 m) with an asphalt and concrete surface; 13/31 is 10,000 by 150 feet (3,048 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface.[1]
Terminal[edit]
Atlantic City International Airport has one terminal, serving all of its flights. Several charter carriers operate out of the terminal, along with the scheduled flights of Spirit Airlines. The terminal has a small layout, making it an alternative to Philadelphia International Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport.
Passengers enter the terminal on the lower-level. This level houses the check-in counters, along with a small grill, and a gift shop. Baggage claim is also on this level, with two carousels. After check-in, passengers proceed to the security checkpoint, which is also on this level. After the security checkpoint are stairs and escalators which lead to the departures level. The 7 gates are housed here, with several open for use by charters, and several in use by the scheduled carriers. All gate areas are uniform, with no customization by the airlines. Also on the second level, there is a cafe, a bar, and a newsstand.
Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal.
Parking[edit]
Atlantic City International Airport has a six-story parking garage with a covered walkway within steps to the terminal building. Surface Parking is within walking distance and shuttle service is provided from the Economy parking area to the terminal building.
The parking garage also houses all of the rental car facilities, which include Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, and Budget.
Ground Transportation[edit]
Taxi service is available at curbside, and a shuttle service is provided by Atlantic City Jitney, located in the airport terminal, outside of Baggage Claim. A shuttle bus brings passengers to the Egg Harbor City Rail Station, which provides service to the Atlantic City Line, which runs from Philadelphia to the Atlantic City Rail Terminal. Shuttles to the Egg Harbor Rail Station connect to shuttles to the Visitors Center at the FAA Technical Center and the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey, as well as bus lines to the PATCO Speedline at the Lindenwold station.

Current construction projects[edit]
The South Jersey Transportation Authority will begin construction of a new Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Station at Atlantic City International Airport. The new 45,000 square foot building will feature multiple vehicle bays, administrative and staff living areas, enhanced equipment and apparatus facilities as well as room for training requirements.
Work began in August 2011 upgrading the Passenger Screening facilities at Atlantic City International Airport. The checkpoint expansion will consist of the addition of 3 new screening lanes as well as improvements to the airport's system infrastructure. The TSA will supply the new screening equipment for the expanded area. The expansion also includes development of a Federal Inspection Services Station. Under this project, equipment will include additional passenger loading bridges and gates, new technological upgrades, baggage carousel improvements, added retail space and improved check-in capabilities.[9]
Airlines and destinations[edit]

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2010, the airport had 105,083 aircraft operations, an average of 288 per day: 50% military, 14% scheduled commercial, 35% general aviation and 1% air taxi. At that time there were 70 aircraft based at this airport: 20% single-engine, 14% multi-engine, 19% jet, 16% helicopter and 31% military.[1]

Plans[edit]

NextGen Technical Park[edit]
A technology park housing Next Generation Air Transportation System is currently under construction on the airport property on a 55-acre (220,000 m2) lot near Amelia Earhart Boulevard and Delilah Road. The seven-building complex is set to contain 408,000 square feet (37,900 m2) of offices, laboratories and research facilities. The park will focus on developing new computer equipment that will transform the country's air-traffic control program into a satellite-based system.[11] The first of the buildings was originally set to open in April 2012 and will contain a lab for the FAA as well as research space for other tenants.[12]
A second office park, the NextGen International Aviation Center for Excellence, is set to be built in nearby Hamilton Township, adjacent to the Hamilton Mall and Atlantic City Race Course, the latter of which is set to be renovated. A new transportation center at the site would transfer workers between the two complexes.[13]
Hotel and Conference center[edit]
In 2009, the SJTA awarded a contract to a Ventnor, New Jersey-based construction firm to construct a hotel on a 13.5-acre (55,000 m2) property leased from the FAA at the intersection of Tilton and Delilah Roads. Plans call for a 135 room hotel including some extended-stay suites, about 6,000 square feet (560 m2) of conference space, 22,000 square feet (2,000 m2) of retail space and possibly a restaurant. The hotel would be built to accommodate a new flood of business travelers brought by the NextGen technical park.[14]
Atlantic City Expressway connector[edit]
The SJTA revealed plans for a major road improvement project that would link the airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with a bridge over Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass at the end of Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township.[15]
Port Authority takeover[edit]

In February 2011, the New Jersey Legislature authorized the Atlantic City Tourism District, which would promote continued development of tourism in the region.[16] A provision included the potential transfer of operations to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[17][18][19]
