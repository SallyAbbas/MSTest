            However, a unique aspect of the San Francisco summer is the rolling fog that blankets the western part of the city during the spring and summer months. This fog is produced by a combination of the cold ocean waters and high heat of California mainland. The eastern half of the city is actually protected from the fog by the hills that rise from the center of the city. In spite of the fog, the summer months are generally considered to be the best time to book a vacation to San Francisco.<br />
