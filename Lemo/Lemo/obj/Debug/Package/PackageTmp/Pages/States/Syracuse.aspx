        <div class="StateContent">
          <p>The city of Syracuse is located in central New York State at the intersection of two main highways Interstate 90 and Interstate 81. This city was christened Syracuse in 1819 because of its similarity with the Sicilian city of Sircusa. Both cities were equipped with salt-water springs and were situated south of towns called Salina. The salt-water springs in Syracuse turned out to be a money spinner for the city in the mid-1840s when the city became the leading producer of salt in the country. <br />
            <br />
            Aside from the production of this vital condiment, the city soon had another claim to fame. As Syracuse is situated on the half-way point of the Erie Canal, it came to be equipped with Weighlock buildings, which were especially constructed next to the canal and were used to measure the passing ships and asses their taxes.<br />
            <br />
          Today Syracuse is known as a university town which is home to prominent colleges and universities like Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Additionally, the city which has a largely industrial feel to it is often used by tourists on vacation as a gateway to the Finger Lakes region though Syracuse does offer some interesting attractions of its own, like the Salt Museum, the Erie Canal Museum and the I.M.Pei designed Everson Museum of Art along with big shopping malls like Destiny USA and the Carousel Center.</p>

Syracuse is equipped with salt water springs and used this natural resource to become the primary producer of salt in the country in the mid-1800s. Salt was produced by creating &lsquo;boiling blocks&rsquo;, which were built to boil water and evaporate the brine. This process succeeded in leaving behind the salt. The museum is equipped with many attractions of this era including a full-scale model of a boiling block, kettles, wooden barrels and more.</p>
