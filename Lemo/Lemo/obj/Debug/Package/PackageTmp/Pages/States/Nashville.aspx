          <div></div>
          <p>Nashville is made up of several distinct neighborhoods but the city is a lot like Los Angeles in its layout as it is spread out over miles of land that once hosted plantations and farms. Hotels and accommodation choices in Nashville can be found in every neighborhood and depending on your preference, you can elect to stay in any neighborhood that you choose. The city is easy to navigate as most of its attractions are located within a short drive of each other. <br />
            <br />
            Downtown Nashville is famous for its many music venues, which include stores and cafes that feature live music performances too. Besides these venues, Downtown Nashville is also home to the District or an area that encompasses Broadway, 2nd Avenue/Riverfront and Printers Alley, which is the heart and soul of the city as it is populated with hotels, shops, restaurants, nightclubs and museums.<br />
            <br />
            The hotels located within Downtown Nashville range from luxury hotels to discount hotels and budget accommodation and even if you don&rsquo;t stay within the District area, it is worth noting that various hotels in Nashville provide free shuttle services to the District area bars and clubs on the weekends.<br />
            <br />
            The West End of Nashville is home to Music Row and if you are a fan of country music then this is the area you must base yourself at. Every major recording label in the United States has an office here along with scores of recording studios. The chances of sighting a musical celebrity within the West End are, therefore, quite high. <br />
            <br />
            You can base yourself at the various hotels located around the city&rsquo;s international airport area known as Music Valley; for it once hosted the attraction of Opryland, an amusement park that was once the home of the &lsquo;Grand Ole Opry&rsquo;. Today Opryland has been converted to Opry Mills, the largest shopping center in the south and offers many great dining and entertainment options.</p>
          <div id="things">Places to see in Nashville</div>

          <div>Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum</div>
          <div></div>
          <p>If you are a county music fan on vacations to Nashville then this downtown Nashville attraction is a must-do on your list. The permanent collection at this museum explores the history of country music through a display of exhibits that include noteworthy costumes (Emmy Lou Harris&rsquo;s jeweled boots), memorabilia, instruments, photographs, manuscripts and other glamorous objects (Elvis Presley&rsquo;s gold leaf covered Cadillac), which are supplemented by live performances and various other interactive exhibits.</p>
          <div>The Ryman Auditorium</div>
          <div></div>
          <p>In 1943, when the crowds got too big and too rowdy for other Nashville venues, the Grand Ole Opry found a home at the Ryman Auditorium. This late Victorian Gothic Revival style edifice was once a church and served as the premier stage for Opry&rsquo;s live radio shows for the next thirty-one years during which it threw up stars like Elvis Presley, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, Minnie Pearl, Patsy Cline and Roy Acuff. The Ryman Auditorium remains a prominent attraction in Nashville until today; even though the Grand Ole Opry is now based at its own Grand Ole Opry House.</p>
          <div>Grand Ole Opry</div>
          <div></div>
          <p>The Ryman auditorium was home to the Grand Olde Opry until 1974. The show then moved to the 4,400-seat Grand Ole Opry House located nine miles east of downtown Nashville on a new site that was part of the Opryland USA theme park. <br />
            <br />
            Once the Opryland shut down in 1997, it was replaced by the Opry Mills mall, Opry House itself was left intact and incorporated into the new facility. Currently, the Opry plays several times a week at the Grand Ole Opry House except for an annual winter run at the Ryman Auditorium. <br />
            <br />
            The Opry has been associated with a wide array of stars like Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, Carrie Underwood, Dixie Chicks and a whole host of others. The show is broadcast live on broadcast live on WSM-AM at 7 p.m. Central Time on Saturday nights though Opry House offers a large number of shows and tours for Nashville vacationers all year long.</p>
          <div>Belle Meade Plantation</div>
          <div></div>
          <p>The Belle Meade Plantation is one attraction in Nashville that is not related to music. The plantation, which hosts a restored 1853 Greek Revival mansion also has other structures like a log cabin that was built in 1790, a carriage house, a tearoom and a visitor center and gift shop. The Belle Meade estate was one of America&rsquo;s finest thoroughbred breeding farms that pre-dates the American Civil war and provides a valuable insight into the lifestyle of America&rsquo;s Deep South.</p>
          <div>Centennial Park</div>
          <div></div>
          <p>The Centennial Park is Nashville&rsquo;s most prominent park located in Nashville&rsquo;s West End neighborhood. This 132-acre verdant park features several attractions like the iconic Parthenon, which is an exact replica of the Parthenon in Athens complete with the statue of Athena that today hosts Nashville&rsquo;s art museum, a one-mile walking trail, Lake Watauga, the Centennial Art Center, historical monuments, a band shell, an events area, sand volleyball courts, two dog parks, and an exercise trail. The park is a hub of constant activity that attracts thousands of visitors each year.</p>

            <br />
