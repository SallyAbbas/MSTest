In 2011 the airport processed 23,349,835 passengers[1] (4.2% more than 2010) including 3,608,922 international passengers (4.7% more than 2010) The facility surpassed 2007/2008 levels by 728,147 passengers. From December 2011 through November 2012, the top five air carriers by domestic market share were: JetBlue Airways at 18.21%; Southwest Airlines at 17.50%; Spirit Airlines at 16.24%; Delta Air Lines at 15.60%; and US Airways at 8.16%.[4] FLL is ranked as the 21st busiest airport (in terms of passenger traffic) in the United States as well as the nation's 14th busiest international air gateway. The facility also ranks as one of the world's 50 busiest airports. FLL is classified by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a "Major Hub" facility serving commercial air traffic.
Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport is a focus city for Allegiant Air and JetBlue Airways. The airport is the largest base for Spirit Airlines, catering mainly to the airline's international to domestic network. It is a hub for Silver Airways. The airport is close to cruise line terminals at Port Everglades and is popular among tourists bound for the Caribbean. Since the late 1990s FLL has emerged as an intercontinental gateway, especially for charter carriers, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights from South Florida. The airport offers free Wi-Fi Internet access throughout its terminals.

History[edit]

Merle Fogg Airport opened on an abandoned 9-hole golf course on May 1, 1929. At the start of World War II, it was commissioned by the United States Navy and renamed Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale. The base was initially used for refitting civil airliners for military service before they were ferried across the South Atlantic to Europe and North Africa. NAS Fort Lauderdale later became a main training base for Naval Aviators and enlisted naval air crewmen flying the TBF and TBM Avenger for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aboard aircraft carriers and from expeditionary airfields ashore. NAS Fort Lauderdale was the home base for Flight 19, the five TBM Avenger aircraft that disappeared in December 1945, leading in part to the notoriety of the Bermuda Triangle.
NAS Fort Lauderdale was closed on October 1, 1946 and transferred to county control, becoming Broward County International Airport.
Commercial flights to Nassau began on June 2, 1953 and domestic flights began in 1958–59: Northeast Airlines and National Airlines DC-6Bs flew nonstop to Idlewild, and Northeast flew nonstop to Washington National. In 1959 the airport opened its first permanent terminal building and assumed its current name.


The airport seen from an airliner
In 1966 the airport averaged 48 airline operations a day; in 1972 it averaged 173 a day. The Feb 1966 Official Airline Guide shows three nonstop departures to JFK and no other nonstops beyond Tampa and Orlando; five years later FLL had added nonstops to ATL, BAL, BOS, BUF, ORD, CLE, DTW, MSP, LGA, EWR, PHL and PIT. (Northeast's nonstop to LAX had already been dropped.)
Operations at FLL didn't grow along with Broward County's population. Low-cost traffic propelled the airport's growth in the 1990s, with Southwest opening its base in 1996, Spirit in 1999, and JetBlue in 2001. Spirit made FLL a hub in 2002 and in 2003 JetBlue made FLL a focus city.
During the 2005 hurricane season FLL was affected by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma. Katrina struck as a Category 1 and caused minor damage, however the airport was closed for about a 48 hour period. However, when Hurricane Wilma made landfall in October roof damage was reported along with broken windows, damaged jetways, and destroyed canopies. The airport was closed for a period of 5 days. Hurricane Wilma was a Category 2 when its center passed to the west of FLL.
Beginning February 2007 the airport started fees to all users, including private aircraft. It is one of a handful of airports to administer fees to private pilots. A minimum charge of $10 is assessed to private aircraft which land at the airport.
The airport has been used by filmmakers numerous times, the most famous of these being scenes from Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise.
Facilities and aircraft[edit]



FAA diagram of FLL
Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport covers an area of 1,380 acres (558 ha) and has two runways:[2]
Runway 10L/28R:[5] 9,002 x 150 ft (2,743 x 46 m) Asphalt
Runway 10R/28L: 5,276 x 100 ft (1,608 x 30 m) Asphalt CLOSED (WILL RE-OPEN 2014)

In 2003 plans were started to expand the facility. Proposed improvements include an extension of runway 9R/27L to accommodate larger jets,[6] construction and modifications to the airport's taxiway system to provide for increased speed, improved inter-terminal passenger movement and extensive terminal upgrades. As of April 25, 2006 the plan for this expansion was being updated a second time. Concerns and complaints by nearby communities about noise from larger jets, along with concerns about buyout requirements, have delayed construction that is expected to keep Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport viable through 2020.[7]
Gulfstream International Airlines has its headquarters in Suite 201 of the 1100 Lee Wagener Blvd building.[8][9] When Chalk's International Airlines existed, its headquarters was on the grounds of the airport in an unincorporated area.[10]
Construction[edit]

Expansion of 9R/27L Runway
On June 5, 2007, Broward County commissioners voted six to three in favor of extending the southern 9R/27L runway. The proposal looks to extend the runway to accommodate larger aircraft and to allow airplanes to land side-by-side at the same time. The proposal was approved by the FAA and expansion of the south runway is now underway and scheduled to open in 2014. The crosswind runway will be decommissioned once the southern runway expansion is completed. All four terminals, now having 57 gates, will have 97 with the completion of a new long-haul international Terminal Four and Concourse A at Terminal One. By 2020 Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood is projected to handle 36 million passengers annually.[11]
Demolition and Reconstruction of Terminal Four
During and after the expansion of runway 9R/27L, reconstruction of Terminal Four will begin at the cost of 450 million. The H concourse will be demolished to build the new "G" concourse. In this process four new gates will be added. Concession space will be increased from 2,128 ft² to 28,000 ft² and a secure walkway will be added to connect terminals three and four.[12]
