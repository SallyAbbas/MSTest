Fairbanks International Airport (IATA: FAI, ICAO: PAFA, FAA LID: FAI) is a state-owned public-use airport located three miles (5 km) southwest of the central business district of Fairbanks, a city in the Fairbanks North Star Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska.[1]
The airport serves many cargo airlines as a convenient refueling stop for some aircraft on trans-polar routes.[dated info] FAI is served by a limited number of passenger airlines. Era Aviation and Alaska Airlines serve the airport year-round, while Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, and recently United Airlines serve FAI during the summer.[2] Fairbanks is the smallest city in the United States with non-stop service to Europe, as Condor Airlines offers weekly flights to Frankfurt during the summer tourist season.[3]
Recently,[when?] the airport constructed a new terminal and demolished the old one. The new terminal is built around the modern TSA standards. In addition to architectural design and better security, the main terminal now has six jet-bridges (up from the former five).[3] The 2,700m² of custom unitised curtain wall was designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong. The special design incorporated double low-e triple glazing. The new building's footprint is smaller than the old building, and it no longer has the museum exhibits in the lobby.
