Dayton /ˈdeɪtn/ is the sixth largest city in the U.S. state of Ohio and is the county seat of Montgomery County.[4] In the 2010 census, the population was 141,527; the Dayton metropolitan area had 799,232 residents, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Ohio and the sixty-first largest in the United States.[5] The Dayton-Springfield-Greenville Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1,080,044 in 2010 and is the 43rd largest in the United States.[6] Dayton is situated within the Miami Valley region of Ohio just north of the Cincinnati–Northern Kentucky metropolitan area.
Ohio's borders are within 500 miles (800 km) of roughly 60% of the country's population and manufacturing infrastructure making the Dayton area a logistical centroid for manufacturers, suppliers, and shippers.[7][8] Dayton also plays host to significant research and development in fields like industrial, aeronautical, and astronautical engineering that have led to many technological innovations. Much of this innovation is due in part to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its place within the community. With the decline of heavy manufacturing, Dayton's businesses have diversified into a service economy that includes insurance and legal sectors as well as healthcare and government sectors.
Other than defense and aerospace, healthcare accounts for much of the Dayton area's economy. Hospitals in the Greater Dayton area have an estimated combined employment of nearly 32,000, a yearly economic impact of $6.8 billion.[9] It is estimated that Premier Health Partners, a hospital network, contributes more than $2 billion a year to the region through operating, employment, and capital expenditures.[10] In 2011, Dayton was rated the #3 city in the nation out of the top 50 cities in the United States by HealthGrades for excellence in health care.[11][12] Many hospitals in the Dayton area are consistently ranked by Forbes, U.S. News & World Report, and HealthGrades for clinical excellence.
Dayton is also noted for its association with aviation; the city is home to the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Orville Wright, poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, and entrepreneur John H. Patterson were born in Dayton. Dayton is also known for its many patents, inventions, and inventors that have come from the area,[13] most notable being the Wright Brothers' invention of powered flight.[14] In 2008, 2009, and 2010, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 mid sized metropolitan area in the nation for economic development.[15][16][17] Also in 2010, Dayton was named one of the best places in the United States for college graduates to find a job.[18][19]

History[edit]

Dayton was founded on April 1, 1796, seven years before the admission of Ohio to the Union in early 1803, by a group of 12 settlers known as "The Thompson Party." They traveled in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of Native Americans. Among the settlers was Benjamin Van Cleve,[20] whose memoirs provide insights into the history of the Ohio Valley. Two other groups who were travelling overland arrived several days later.[21]
In 1797, Daniel C. Cooper had laid out the Mad River Road, the first overland connection between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Dayton, opening the "Mad River Country" at Dayton and the upper Miami Valley to settlement.
The city was incorporated in 1805 and was named after Jonathan Dayton, who owned the land. Dayton had been a captain in the American Revolutionary War and was a signer of the U.S. Constitution.[22] By 1827, construction on the Dayton-Cincinnati canal began as a way to better transport goods from Dayton to Cincinnati. The canal provided the main source of growth for Dayton at the time.[22]
Historically, Dayton has been the site for many patents and inventions since the 1870s.[13][23] Famous inventors such as the Wright Brothers, who invented the practical airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, who had numerous inventions, also came from Dayton. According to the National Park Service, citing information from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had more granted patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870.[24][25]
The 1890s brought several key persons to the forefront of Dayton's historical achievements. The first, Paul Laurence Dunbar an African American poet, began his most famous works in the 1890s and is an integral part of Dayton's history. Dunbar became a nationally recognized poet.[26] The second were the Wright Brothers who were credited for inventing the world's first successful airplane and founding the Wright Cycle Company.[27]


Dayton in 1870
In 1884, The National Cash Register Company was founded by John Henry Patterson which manufactured the first cash registers in existence.[28] The company played a crucial role in the success and shaping of Dayton as a manufacturing center and in the livelihood of Dayton residents as a source of employment and tax revenue. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering introduced the first electric cash register to the company. This helped to further increase the presence and production of NCR.[29] After the Great Dayton Flood, John Patterson donated nearly one million dollars to help with cleanup and rescue efforts. This move helped to further draw the importance of the company to Dayton.[30] NCR was also known for its code-breaking machines, including the American Navy bombe designed by Joseph Desch which helped crack the Enigma machine cipher.[31]
The catastrophic Great Dayton Flood of March 1913 severely affected much of the city, stimulated the growth of suburban communities outside central Dayton in areas lying further from the Miami River and on higher ground, and led to the establishment of the Miami Conservancy District in 1914.[32] The flood remains an event of note in popular memory and local histories. The high waters damaged some of the Wright Brothers' glass plate photographic negatives of their glider flights at Kitty Hawk and power flights over Huffman Prairie near Dayton.
During World War II, Dayton, like many other American cities, was heavily involved in the war effort. Residential neighborhoods in Dayton and in nearby Oakwood hosted the Dayton Project, in which the Monsanto Chemical Company developed methods to industrially produce polonium for use in the triggers of early atomic bombs, including those dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.[33] Because of Dayton's manufacturing boom to support war efforts, housing in the Dayton area was in extremely high demand. In an attempt for the region to keep up, emergency housing was put into place because of a lack of dwellings in the region. Many of these dwellings that were meant to be temporary are still inhabited today.[34]
Between the 1940s and the 1970s, significant suburban growth began to take place. Along with the implementation of the Interstate Highway System, more than 1.8 million homes were built in Montgomery County alone between 1950 and 1960. Many of these homes were built in neighboring suburbs as growth in the city proper of Dayton slowed.[35] Despite Dayton's slowed growth, many of Dayton's high-rise buildings were also constructed during this period.
From the 1980s to recent times, Dayton's population has declined due to the drop in heavy manufacturing and national economic woes. Despite this, Dayton has diversified its workforce from manufacturing to healthcare and defense. It is recognized as Ohio's aerospace hub.[36][37]
The 2000s brought revitalization to Dayton's urban core. Fifth Third Field, home of the Dayton Dragons, was built in 2000. The stadium and minor league baseball team have been an important part of Dayton's culture. The Dragons have the nation's longest sellout streak in all professional sports, and they remain very popular in the region.[38] The Schuster Center performing arts theater, which opened in 2003, provides a new arts venue for the city.[39] Miami Valley Hospital added a 12-story patient tower. Five Rivers MetroParks expanded and added a bike hub, as well as an outdoor entertainment venue for concerts downtown.[40][41]
In 2010, the city introduced the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan. It focuses on job creation and retention, infrastructure improvements, housing, recreation, and collaboration. The plan is to be implemented through the year 2020.[42]
Peace accords[edit]
Main article: Dayton Agreement
The Dayton Agreement, a peace accord between the parties to the hostilities of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia, was negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Negotiations took place from November 1, 1995, to November 21, 1995, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Fairborn, Ohio.
Richard Holbrooke wrote about this event in his memoirs:
There was also a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as the birthplace of the Wright Brothers. Its citizens energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York, Geneva or Washington, which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed "candles of peace" in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.[43]
Nickname[edit]
Dayton is known as the "Gem City." The origin of the nickname is uncertain, but several theories exist. In the early 19th century, a well-known racehorse named "Gem" hailed from Dayton. In 1845, an article published in the Cincinnati Daily Chronicle by an author known as "T" stated:
"In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns. It possesses wealth, refinement, enterprise, and a beautiful country, beautifully developed."[44]


Historic Sacred Heart Church
In the late 1840s, Major William D. Bickham of the Dayton Journal initiated a campaign to officially nickname Dayton as the "Gem City". The name was eventually adopted by the city's Board of Trade several years later.[44] Paul Laurence Dunbar referred to the nickname in his poem, "Toast to Dayton", as noted in the following excerpt:
She shall ever claim our duty,
For she shines--the brightest gem
That has ever decked with beauty
     Dear Ohio's diadem.[45]
Dayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio – "Birthplace of Aviation". Dayton is the hometown of the Wright Brothers, aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the world's first successful airplane. After their first manned flights in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, which had been chosen due to its ideal weather and climate conditions, the Wrights returned to Dayton and continued testing at nearby Huffman Prairie.[46]
Geography[edit]

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.50 square miles (146.33 km2), of which, 55.65 square miles (144.13 km2) is land and 0.85 square miles (2.20 km2) is water.[1]
Climate[edit]
Dayton's climate features hot, muggy summers and cold, dry winters, and is either classified as a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), using the −3 °C (26.6 °F) isotherm of the original Köppen scheme, or a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm preferred by some climatologists. It should be noted that the table presented above is from Dayton International Airport, at an elevation of 1,000 ft (304.8 m) about 10 mi (16 km) to the north of downtown Dayton, which lies within the Miami Valley, and thus temperatures in the former location are often cooler than in downtown.[47]
At the airport, monthly mean temperatures range from 27.5 °F (−2.5 °C) in January to 74.1 °F (23.4 °C) in July. The highest temperature ever recorded in Dayton was 108 °F (42 °C) on July 22, 1901, and the coldest was −28 °F (−33 °C) on February 13, 1899. On average, there are 14 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs and 4.5 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows annually.
Dayton is subject to severe weather typical of the Midwestern United States. Tornadoes are possible from the spring to the fall. Floods, blizzards and severe thunderstorms can also occur from time to time.

Note: the following demographic information applies only to the city of Dayton proper. For other Dayton-area communities, see their respective articles.
The population of Dayton has been declining since the 1960s, as can be observed from portrayal of historical population data. This is in part due to the slowdown of manufacturing in the region and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville.[53][54] The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010.[55]

Dayton's economy is relatively diversified and vital to the overall economy of the state of Ohio. In 2008 and 2009, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 medium-sized metropolitan area in the U.S. for economic development.[15][16] Dayton is also among the top 100 metropolitan areas in both exports and export-related jobs, ranked 16 and 14 respectively by the Brookings Institution. The 2010 report placed the value of exports at $4.7 billion and the number of export-related jobs at 44,133.[56] The Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area ranks 4th in Ohio's Gross Domestic Product with a 2008 industry total of $33.78 billion.[57] Additionally, Dayton ranks third among 11 major metropolitan areas in Ohio for exports to foreign countries.[58] The Dayton Development Coalition is attempting to leverage the regions large water capacity, estimated to be 1.5 trillion gallons of renewable water aquifers, to attract new businesses.[59][60] Moody's Investment Services revised Dayton's bond rating from A1 to the stronger rating of Aa2 as part of its global recalibration process. Standard and Poor's upgraded Dayton's rating from A+ to AA- in the summer of 2009.[61]
Bloomberg Businessweek ranked Dayton in 2010 as one of the best places in the U.S. for college graduates looking for a job.[18][19] Companies such as Reynolds and Reynolds, CareSource, DPL, LexisNexis, Kettering Health Network, Premier Health Partners, and Standard Register have their headquarters in Dayton. It is also the former home of the Speedwell Motor Car Company, MeadWestvaco (formerly known as the Mead Paper Company), and NCR. NCR was headquartered in Dayton for over 125 years and was a major innovator in computer technology.[62]
Research, development, aerospace and aviation[edit]

The Dayton region gave birth to aviation[63] and is known for its high concentration of aerospace and aviation technology. In 2009, Governor Ted Strickland designated Dayton as Ohio's aerospace innovation hub, the first such technology hub in the state.[64] Two major United States research and development organizations have leveraged Dayton's historical leadership in aviation and maintain their headquarters in the area: The National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). NASIC is the U.S. military's primary producer of intelligence on foreign air and space forces, weapons and systems, while the AFRL provides leading-edge warfighting capabilities to keep the United States air, space and cyberspace forces the world's best.[65] Both have their headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.[66] Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is one of the largest air base wings in the Air Force. Its over 27,400 employees and 68 tenant units generated a Total Economic Impact in the Dayton area of $5.1 billion in its 2009 fiscal year.[67] In addition, state officials are working to make the Dayton region a hub and a leader for UAV research and manufacturing.[68]

Several research organizations support NASIC, AFRL and the Dayton community. The Advanced Technical Intelligence Center, is a confederation of government, academic and industry partners that leverage advanced technical intelligence expertise. daytaOhio is a non-profit organization based at Wright State University in Dayton. The University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI), is led by the University of Dayton. In 2004 and 2005, UDRI was ranked #2 in the nation by the National Science Foundation in federal and industry-funded materials research. The Cognitive Technologies Division (CTD) of Applied Research Associates, Inc., which carries out human-centered research and design, is headquartered in the Dayton suburb of Fairborn. The city of Dayton has started Tech Town, a development project intended to attract technology-based firms and revitalize the downtown area. Tech Town is home to the world's first RFID business incubator.[69] The University of Dayton-led Institute for Development & Commercialization of Sensor Technologies (IDCAST) at TechTown is a world-class center for excellence in remote sensing and sensing technology. It is one of Dayton's technology business incubators housed in The Entrepreneurs Center building.[70]
Healthcare[edit]

The Kettering Health Network and Premier Health Partners have a major role on the Dayton area's economy. Hospitals in the Greater Dayton area have an estimated combined employment of nearly 32,000, a yearly economic impact of $6.8 billion.[9] In addition, several Dayton area hospitals consistently earn top national ranking and recognition including the U.S. News & World Report's list of "America's Best Hospitals" as well as many of HealthGrades top ratings.[71] The most notable hospitals are Miami Valley Hospital and Kettering Medical Center. In 2011, the Dayton area was rated number three in the nation out of the top 50 cities in the United States by HealthGrades for excellence in healthcare.[11][12] Also in 2011, Dayton was ranked the fourth best in the nation for emergency medicine care.[72] Then in 2013, HealthGrades ranked the Dayton region number one in the nation for the lowest hospital mortality rate.[73]
Several key institutes and centers for health care exist in the Dayton region. The Center for Tissue Regeneration and Engineering at Dayton is a center that focuses on the science and development of human tissue regeneration. The National Center for Medical Readiness (NCMR) is also located in the Dayton area. The center includes Calamityville which is a state-of-the art disaster training facility. It is conservatively estimated that over a period of five years, Calamityville will have a regional economic impact of $374 million.[74] Also, the Neurological Institute at Miami Valley Hospital is an institute focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and research of neurological disorders.

Unlike many midwestern cities of its age, Dayton has very broad and straight downtown streets (generally two or three full lanes in each direction), facilitating access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning: streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around. In addition, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.


Mutual Home Savings Building
A courthouse building was constructed in downtown Dayton in 1888 to supplement Dayton's original Neoclassical courthouse, which still stands. This second, "new" courthouse has since been replaced with new facilities as well as a park. The Old Court House has been a favored political campaign stop. On September 17, 1859, future president Abraham Lincoln delivered an address on the steps of the building. Eight other presidents have visited the courthouse, either as presidents or during presidential campaigns. They include Andrew Johnson, James Garfield, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton.[76]
In 2009, the CareSource Management Group finished construction of a $55 million corporate headquarters in downtown Dayton. The 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2), 10-story building marks downtown's first new office tower in more than a decade.[77]
The two tallest buildings of the Dayton skyline are the Kettering Tower at 408 ft (124 m) and the KeyBank Tower at 385 ft (117 m).[78] Kettering Tower was originally Winters Tower, the headquarters of Winters Bank.
