        </div>
        <div class="StateContent">
          <p>The city of Cleveland is located in the US state of Ohio towards the north eastern part of the state on the southern shore of Lake Erie and near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. <br />
            <br />
            Cleveland was founded in 1796 and due to its strategic location near the Erie-Ohio Canal; that links the Ohio River to Lake Erie; it went on to become an industrial powerhouse that hosted industries like shipbuilding and oil refining. Industrial activity gave birth to several tycoons in Cleveland who have contributed massively to the growth and development of the city&rsquo;s key areas. <br />
            <br />
          However, over the years, heavy manufacturing declined and with it Cleveland also shed its gritty, industrial image and became a bustling metropolis equipped with various green spaces, trendy clubs, restaurants, mega malls, museums and other cultural attractions that draw many visitors to its erstwhile industrial shores. The development is evident for vacationers who can trawl around the The Rock and Roll Music Hall of Fame or laze around in the many gardens.</p>

          <p>Cleveland real estate growth was initially influenced by the proximity of water bodies such as Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River. <br />
            <br />
            In general, the west side of Cleveland grew to become more industrial in nature and came to be inhabited by a predominately working class population while the east side of the river came to be occupied by a wealthier and more educated populace. The city&rsquo;s Downtown area around Public Square soon became the financial district and railroad hub of the city. <br />
            <br />
            Downtown Cleveland continues to be the epicenter of the city that is home to several sporting and cultural attractions like Progressive Field, Playhouse Square and the theater district along Euclid Avenue as well as other neighborhoods like the historic Warehouse District and Flats Village. <br />
