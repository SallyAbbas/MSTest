        </div>
        <div class="StateContent">
          <p>The port city of Detroit is located on the Detroit River and is the largest city in the US state of Michigan. It is also the oldest city in the American mid-west. <br />
            <br />
            Vacations to Detroit take you to the famed birthplace of the US auto industry and the renowned Motown record label. Detroit was also established as a trading post in 1701 by a French explorer, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who built a fort to establish the city on the banks of the Detroit River.<br />
            <br />
            Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac was removed from his post due to bad conduct but Detroit continued to grow and develop. In 1796 it became an American city which went on to produce most of the automobiles that were sold in America: Fords, Oldsmobiles, Chevrolets, Dodges became household names that ruled the US car market until the 1980&rsquo;s when they came up against Japanese imports and failed to leave an impression.<br />
            <br />
            Besides auto industry, Detroit is also famed as the birthplace of the Motown sound, which gave rise to stars like Stevie Wonder, the Temptations, the Jackson 5 and Diana Ross.<br />
            <br />
          Today, Detroit has lost some of its glory that was omnipresent during the boom times of the US car industry; though the city still has much to offer for visitors who take time to visit this erstwhile first city of the US automobile industry. For automobile lovers, Detroit vacations are a treat indeed.</p>
